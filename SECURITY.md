## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, users should contact the Windows Security Response Center (WSRC). They can expect to receive an acknowledgement of the receipt of their report within 24 hours. From there, the issue will be investigated and updates will be provided during the investigation. If the reported vulnerability is accepted, it will be fixed by Microsoft, and the reporter will be credited in Microsoft's public acknowledgement. If the vulnerability is declined, a justification will be provided to the reporter.
